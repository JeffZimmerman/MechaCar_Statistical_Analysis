# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The analysis draws on test results for 50 prototype MechaCars to identify factors that predict vehicle performance measured in mpg. Multiple metrics were considered, including vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance.

* Two variables provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset: vehicle length and ground clearance.
* The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The p-value of 5.35e-11 is much smaller than the significance level, leading to a rejection of the null hypothesis.
* The linear model predicts the mpg of prototypes effectively. The r-squared is 0.715, meaning there is a roughly 72% chance that future predictions will fit this model.
